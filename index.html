        <p id="passage" class="text-sm leading-6">
          A. Staying up an hour or two past bedtime makes it far harder for kids
          to learn, say scientists who deprived youngsters of sleep and tested
          whether their teachers could tell the difference. They could. If
          parents want their children to thrive academically, “Getting them to
          sleep on time is as important as getting them to school on time," said
          psychologist Gahan Fallone, who conducted the research at Brown
          Medical School.

          <br /><br />
          B. The study, unveiled Thursday at an American Medical Association
          (AMA) science writers meeting, was conducted on healthy children who
          had no evidence of sleep- or learning-related disorders. Difficulty
          paying attention was among the problems the sleepy youngsters faced -
          raising the question of whether sleep deprivation could prove even
          worse for people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or
          ADHD. Fallone now is studying that question, and suspects that sleep
          problems “could hit children with ADHD as a double whammy”.

          <br /><br />
          C. Sleep experts have long warned that Americans of all ages do not
          get enough shuteye. Sleep is important for health, bringing a range of
          benefits that, as Shakespeare put it, “knits up the ravelled sleave of
          care”. Not getting enough is linked to a host of problems, from car
          crashes as drivers doze off to crippled memory and inhibited
          creativity. Exactly how much sleep correlates with school performance
          is hard to prove. So, Brown researchers set out to test whether
          teachers could detect problems with attention and learning when
          children stayed up late - even if the teachers had no idea how much
          sleep their students actually got.

          <br /><br />
          D. They recruited seventy-four 6- to 12-year-olds from Rhode Island
          and southern Massachusetts for the three-week study. For one week, the
          youngsters went to bed and woke up at their usual times. They already
          were fairly good sleepers, getting nine to 9.5 hours of sleep a night.
          Another week, they were assigned to spend no fewer than ten hours in
          bed a night. The other week, they were kept up later than usual: First
          -and second-graders were in bed no more than eight hours and the older
          children no more than 6.5 hours. In addition to parents’ reports, the
          youngsters wore motiondetecting wrist monitors to ensure compliance.

          <br /><br />
          E. Teachers were not told how much the children slept or which week
          they stayed up late, but rated the students on a variety of
          performance measures each week. The teachers reported significantly
          more academic problems during the week of sleep deprivation, the
          study, which will be published in the journal Sleep in December,
          concluded. Students who got eight hours of sleep or less a night were
          more forgetful, had the most trouble learning new lessons, and had the
          most problems paying attention, reported Fallone, now at the Forest
          Institute of Professional Psychology.

          <br /><br />F. Sleep has long been a concern of educators.
          Potter-Burns Elementary School sends notes to parents reminding them
          to make sure students get enough sleep prior to the school’s yearly
          achievement testing. Another school considers it important enough to
          include in the school’s monthly newsletters. Definitely, there is an
          impact on students’ performance if they come to school tired. However,
          the findings may change physician practice, said Dr. Regina Benjamin,
          a family physician in Bayou La Batre, who reviewed the data at the
          Thursday’s AMA meeting. “I don't ask about sleep” when evaluating
          academically struggling students, she noted. “I’m going to start.”

          <br />
          <br />G. So how much sleep do kids need? Recommended amounts range
          from about ten to eleven hours a night for young elementary students
          to 8.5 hours for teens. Fallone insists that his own second-grader get
          ten hours a night, even when it meant dropping soccer - season that
          practice did not start until 7:30 — too late for her to fit in dinner
          and time to wind down before she needed to be snoozing. “It’s tough,”
          he acknowledged, but “parents must believe in the importance of
          sleep."
